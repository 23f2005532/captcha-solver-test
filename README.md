# Captcha Solver Web App

This is a polished, production-ready single-page web application that displays a captcha image and allows users to input the text they see to verify they are human.

## Setup

Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. No server setup is required.

## Usage

1. View the captcha image displayed on the page.
2. Enter the text you see in the input box.
3. Click the 'Verify' button.
4. The app will inform you if the captcha was verified successfully or if you need to try again.

## Attachments

- `sample.png`: The captcha image displayed on the page, embedded directly as a base64 data URI.

## Assumptions

- The captcha text in the sample image is "sample".
- The verification is simulated; in a real app, this would involve server-side validation.

## Notes

- The app is responsive and accessible, with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.
- Uses Bootstrap CDN for styling and responsiveness.
